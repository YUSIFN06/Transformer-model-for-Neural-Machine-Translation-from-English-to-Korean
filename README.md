**Neural Machine Translation (NMT) English-to-Korean Transformer Model**

This project implements a state-of-the-art Transformer-based Neural Machine Translation model designed to translate English sentences into Korean. Leveraging the Transformer architecture, which relies on multi-head self-attention mechanisms and positional encodings, the model effectively captures contextual dependencies in both source and target languages without relying on recurrent structures.

Key features include:

* **Encoder-Decoder architecture:** The encoder processes input English sentences into rich contextual embeddings, while the decoder generates fluent Korean translations.
* **Text preprocessing and tokenization:** Custom tokenizers for English and Korean handle vocabulary construction and sequence preparation, including special tokens for start-of-sequence (SOS) and end-of-sequence (EOS).
* **Attention mechanisms:** Multi-head attention enables the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sentence during translation, improving accuracy and fluency.
* **Positional encoding:** Injects word order information, crucial for understanding sentence structure in both languages.
* **Teacher forcing during training:** Helps the model learn efficiently by conditioning the decoder on ground-truth target sequences.
* **Custom training loop with masking:** Handles padding tokens and prevents information leakage using padding and look-ahead masks.

This Transformer-based NMT model serves as a powerful tool for English-Korean translation tasks and provides a strong foundation for further improvements such as domain adaptation or fine-tuning on specialized datasets.
